# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command, `snippet` to add a Zephyr snippet, and
# `artifact-name` to assign a name to distinguish build outputs from each other:
#
 board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
 shield: [ "tbk_mini" ]
 include:
   - board: nice_nano_v2
     shield: tbk_mini_right
   - board: nice_nano_v2
     shield: tbk_mini_left
   - board: nice_nano_v2
